Hi I am Maerie Yu I am a well-rounded artist be it traditional, crafting, graphic arts, animation , structural arts and many more you can also check it out in my page seychiedraws hehe. I am hoping to be able to use this platform to express my art. At the moment it is not easy for me since I am dyslexic, but it is what it is I am expecting to struggle, delayed learning and sleepless nights but it is okay as long as I tried and proved to myself again that I can be logical thinker and creative thinker at the same time. I graduated in BSIT and at some point I achieved a title which is 2nd DL, became a semi-coach in my technical account in BPO so what am I going to lose? sleep maybe but other than that nothing else, so I will just try to enjoy and learn.
